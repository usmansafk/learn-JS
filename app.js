//Functions - declare/invoke
//Allow you to write code in one place and then reuse that code all throughout your application without having to copy/paste

//to declare a function, use the function keyword,
//give it a name,
//then give it () , these can also take paramaters
//then open and close curly brace {}
//inside the braces goes the logic

//declare
function sayHello() {
  //logic
  console.log("Hello");
}

//to invoke:
sayHello();
